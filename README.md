# Heart-Failure-Prediction-and-Analysis

This goal of this project is to determine if a patient could potentially have a heart disease or a failure on the basis of his or her previous medical records. 
It also aims to identify the factors that influence the patientâ€™s risk of having a heart failure using various statistical methods and picking the one which provides the most accurate results. 
The literature review paper includes a brief introduction to our problem along with the review of other papers that discuss a similar problem. It also includes the visualizations for the dataset and our initial analysis and insights in order to accomplish a better understanding of it.
The python notebook includes the exploratory data analysis conducted on the heart.csv dataset. (Path to the file needs to be changed accordingly)
